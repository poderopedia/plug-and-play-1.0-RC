##Welcome

Welcome to the Development Version of the API (Application Programming Interface) of Poderopedia.
We have decided to release it for those interested in it. Anyone can try it and we would appreciate your feedback.

The first alpha version of the Poderopedia API allows:

* Generate views of the entities in the Poderopedia database and its connections using the D3.js library.
* Search the database for basic information of the entities in Poderopedia.

To use the Poderopedia API you must get an API Key from Poderopedia that will be required at each visit you make.

To get an API Key from Poderopedia, first you must go to our registration site. Upon entering you will be asked to log on to the page. If you're not registered, you'll be asked to register, initiating the validation process through your email. When the validation is complete, you can enter the system and get your API Key selecting “Give me my API Keys now”.

The Poderopedia API is subject to our Use Terms and Conditions. Read them for more information.

If you're interested in taking part in the development and improvement of our API, give us your feedback or link us to projetcs that use the Poderopedia API. Please write to Juan Eduardo at juan.eduardo@poderopedia.com  


##Consult an Entity

To query an entity in the system, you should have a GET type request to the URL http://api.poderopedia.org/visualizacion/getEntityById.

By doing so, you'll receive a JSON object like the one shown in the following example:

Also the Entity itself (person or organization) and user_key, which corresponds to the API Key obtained in the previous step. By doing so, you'll receive a JSON object like the one shown in the following example:
